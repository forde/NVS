+ create media browser / selector (with ability to add / edit / remove images to / from sanity cdn)
+ add possibility to embed videos youtube / vimeo to rich text editor
+ add possibility to add images (from media browser) to rich text editor
+ add possibility to add a link to sanity  document (or external) to rich text editor
+ add checkbox component
+ add radio component
+ create client authentication and only use sanity client with token from next api layer when logged in

Must have:
- abstract editor to separate npm package
- make rich text editor compatible with sanity portabkle text editor :/


Nice to have:
- add multiple image support to module "thumb" in browser + slider
-
